# PrZero

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

# Feature Ideas

- Mark a PR as "waiting for"
  - response to comment
  - requested changes
- Mark a PR as approved by me
- Mark a PR as viewed, don't need to comment, but want to stay on top of it
  - For these I don't want to see it back in my inbox until something new has happened
- Mark a PR as high-priority
- Mark a user as high-priority
