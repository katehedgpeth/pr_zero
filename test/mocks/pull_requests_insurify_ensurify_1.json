Hence, this PR will be merged one day before the above mentioned [PR](https://github.com/insurify/ensurify/pull/14151). Then commands will be executed to create and populate the new table. Next day this [PR](https://github.com/insurify/ensurify/pull/14151) will be merged and commands will be executed to populate the new table and the switch the tables.\r\n\r\n### Checklist (please mark

[channels](https://github.com/django/channels) from 3.0.5 to 4.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/blob/main/CHANGELOG.txt\">channels's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>4.0.0 (2022-10-15)</h2>\n<p>Channels 4 is the next major version of the Channels package. Together with the\nmatching Daphne v4 and channels-redis v4 releases, it updates dependencies,\nfixes issues, and removes outdated code. It so provides the foundation for\nChannels development going forward.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you can update now by updating <code>channels</code>, <code>daphne</code>, and\n<code>channels-redis</code> as appropriate, with <code>pip</code>, and by adding <code>daphne</code> at\nthe top of your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting.</p>\n<p>First <code>pip</code>::</p>\n<pre><code>pip install -U 'channels[dapne]' channels-redis\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then in your Django settings file::</p>\n<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [\n    &quot;daphne&quot;,\n    ...\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, this is a major version change. Amongst other changes, large amounts of\nthe Django-wrapping code deprecated in Channels v3 has now been removed, in\nfavour of Django's own ASGI handling, and the <code>runserver</code> command has been\nmoved into the Daphne package.</p>\n<p>Please ensure to review the <code>Version 4.0.0 release notes &lt;https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/4.0.0.html&gt;</code>_ for full\ndetails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/42760f9be5f66fd2dbf9b2e77fc84800a481b905\"><code>42760f9</code></a> Updated release date for v4.0.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/1874fbbebb92e5f8e2186eb4ee871226c65964f3\"><code>1874fbb</code></a> Bumped version for 4.0 release.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/fa1a09d8a073ecddf422878b264d7eef82c60f0a\"><code>fa1a09d</code></a> Added release notes for version 4.0.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/fc96650a63aa54ef43626831f7e0923c6a6b2bb7\"><code>fc96650</code></a> Set daphne extra dependency for 4.0.0 final release.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/466a8d33d0d156b91ee527f8535a0aa5f3d371c4\"><code>466a8d3</code></a> Updated changenotes for <code>ChannelsLiveServerTestCase</code> adjustments.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/985f1763edc05fcb00bd4c331c9a67d8627300ee\"><code>985f176</code></a> Make live test case use pickleable DaphneProcess</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/django/channels/commit/f162a4b0e3bec0f0dcf357f24f05ac5d8a15f21a\"><code>f162a4b</code></a> Fix typo in the tutorial.

introduced in the qualifying questions table to include information regarding user having multiple vehicles and for that purpose a new migration has been added that will only run on non production environments. On production manually commands will be executed, details in the [comment](https://github.com/insurify/ensurify/pull/14151#issuecomment-1278565126) below. \r\nAlso qualifying questions table's primary key name was other than id hence some modifications had to be done in the migrate table command to incorporate migration of any such table whose primary key name is other than id.\r\n\r\n### Checklist

Summary of changes\r\n**Asana Task:** [Enable PQL on the backend for Chime](https://app.asana.com/0/1201656633940160/1202943346510556)\r\n\r\nPQL resorting of quotes and ads enabled on external API (Chime).\r\nWe'll be using a fixed pql model for external API calls (Chime) and not use PQL for the mobile app yet.\r\n\r\nI've factored out pql rules out of the views and into a pql_rules.py file. This removed lots of code and relies on context from the request object. This led to delete quite may lines in views.py\r\n\r\nI fixed one test file that relied on relative path to a testing data file and was failing when ran on it's own or via Pycharm.\r\n\r\n###
