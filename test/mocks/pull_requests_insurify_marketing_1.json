Summary of changes\r\n**Asana Task:** [TASK_NAME](TASK_LINK)\r\n\r\nMy modification of the requirements and readme reflects my difficulty in setting up the environment with a new MacBook M1\r\n1. changed from a specific python version to python3 venv. I am open to using virtualenv if we really want a specific python version. Python 3.7.5 is quite old and a chore to get working with the new MacBooks.2. \r\n\r\n2. limited requirements.txt to mostly direct imports (few transitive dependencies). I encountered issues with installing grpcio, numpy, pandas, psycopg2-binary. There also appear to be many unused packages like google-ads. Limiting these packages will be easier to maintain and upgrade. \r\n\r\n3. Refreshed the readme. I tried to align with the Airflow repo readme. Be more explicit about creating a dedicated virtual environment.\r\n\r\nI'm new to this repo, so I intend this to be an open discussion\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-30T03:49:46Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T18:58:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc443d4705f48f80c9a3c6627e00262fc2c6546b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ThomasMcMahon-99","id":7142976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDI5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7142976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasMcMahon-99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasMcMahon-99/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"richychn","id":25440433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDQwNDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25440433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn","html_url":"https://github.com/richychn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richychn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"salman-cheema","id":33802734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODAyNzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33802734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema","html_url":"https://github.com/salman-cheema","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salman-cheema/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"isaacsantelli","id":52387295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzg3Mjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52387295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli","html_url":"https://github.com/isaacsantelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isaacsantelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"antoninsurify","id":75359469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzU5NDY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75359469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify","html_url":"https://github.com/antoninsurify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antoninsurify
